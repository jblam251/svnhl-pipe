Interprating VCF Output Files
-----------------------------

05 07 2019

- Number of Calls per Tool:
	Delly:    5214
	Brkdncr:  3181
	CNVnator: 555

- Do these calls align? initially doesnt appear so

- something to consider...
	Delly: 	Tumor + Normal 	+ REF   = VCF
	Brkdnr: Tumor + Normal 		= TSV
	CNVna: 	Tumor 		+ REF   = TSV

		* does it matter that some dont even consider the reference?

- script 'script1.awk' will parse the breakpoint positions, include a 50-size window around each position, then prepare them for grep ("^number$).  When grepping cnvnator positions +/-50 to breakdancer and delly, no matches were found

- next time:
	- read lit on vcf merging
	- look at KNOWN SVs on chr13 canine...are ANY tools deteciting events?
	- again, review the tools' publications 

- using 20bp windows (and 'posts') to detect any overlap among tsv files. this is done using script1.awk. 

- sofwtare (SURVIVOR or SVDB) may be able to do the same thing but much faster

- results....breakdancer and delly appear to have some overlap (~300 / 3181 calls).  this is also at a relitively small window (20bp).  however, cnvnator isn't calling any overlap whatsoever.  this makes sense, as cnvnator calls BINS, not single-base resolution breakpoints.  

- currently two commands were executed to compare breakdancer+delly vcfs:

  	$ grep -f delly_window brkdncr_posts > delly_brkdncr.mrg
  	$ grep -f brkdncr_window delly_posts > brkdncr_delly.mrg

	* these files are SLIGHTLY different (3 of 293 calles were included in 
	one output, but not in the other. how is this possible?
