- lots of work done on manual merging/comparing of vcf files

- using 20bp windows (and 'posts') to detect any overlap among tsv files. this is done using script1.awk. 

- sofwtare (SURVIVOR or SVDB) may be able to do the same thing but much faster

- results....breakdancer and delly appear to have some overlap (~300 / 3181 calls).  this is also at a relitively small window (20bp).  however, cnvnator isn't calling any overlap whatsoever.  this makes sense, as cnvnator calls BINS, not single-base resolution breakpoints.  

- currently two commands were executed to compare breakdancer+delly vcfs:

        $ grep -f delly_window brkdncr_posts > delly_brkdncr.mrg
        $ grep -f brkdncr_window delly_posts > brkdncr_delly.mrg

        * these files are SLIGHTLY different (3 of 293 calles were included in 
        one output, but not in the other. how is this possible?

- more research is needed, specifically how researchers merge CNVnator output files.  remember, they are bins not precise breakpoints
