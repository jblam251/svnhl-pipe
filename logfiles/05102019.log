- modifying SURVIVOR merge command, a VCF was created (sample_merge1k-3.vcf) that contained 43 calles which ALL three tools called at a 1k bp window

- this vcf was loaded into IGV and a few more images were saved

******
- Two Key Challanges at the Moment
	1. Whats the best way to merge the cnvnator calls? cnvnator makes
	  calls in bins, unlike the other two tools that have single base
	  resolution
	2. need a way to test the efficacy of the pipeline....how can I 
	  tell if the calls being made are legitimate?
		- SURVOVIR: simulate, evaluate, merge
			* this will require simulated bam reads (which
			can be done using MASON software or another tool
			called CreateTranslocations
			* can use own reads, however, would have to re-align
			the data
		- CreateTranslations can simulate SVs AND produce bamfiles

	*** FIGURE OUT WHAT DATA IS BEING COMPARED IN EACH TOOL
	ie. cnvnator is based on BBAM vs REF, while delly is BBAM v FBAM
