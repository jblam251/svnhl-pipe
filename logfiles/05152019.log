- lots of work on VCF analysis and differenciating bt germline/somatic calls
- each tool requires a different set of commands to isolate somatic events
	* see "somatic-calls" folder for info on all three tools

- currently, DELLY and breakdancer have isolated somatic calls
- CNVnator does not, as it requires two runs (one with tumor and one with normal) then a user-comoparison and genotypinc of the resulting tsvs
	* need to come up with useful way of isoating somatic calls for CNVn
