- lots of work with CNVnator output
- two ways to merge the cnvnator data
	1. script to splice out somatic and germline variants from cnvn outs
	   - this is mostly finished (canineLymphoma_demo/somatic-calling/somati	   c-callingC/script3.sh)
	   - with this output, we could run the provided cnvn2VCF script to 
	   merge somatic calls into VCF format
	2. analyize the genotype data from cnvnator -genotype
	   - this requires you call cnvnator -genotype and set bin sizes
  	   - then, create custom script to compare CN at each bin location
	   - this would require a second script to turn the outpt into VCF
	   - may be good for graphing though...
	   - outputs already generated on cluster, see genotype500 and B/F500
