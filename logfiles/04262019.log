- working to homogenize delly and breakdancer vcffiles

- Core fields are compatable, FORMAT fields need work (see written notes)

- edited script (/scripts/jb_edits/breakdancer2vcf_JB.sh)

- also, quality considerations!
	- DELLY Defaults: 
		PE >= 3, (NOT CHANGABLE??)
		MAPQ >=20 (MAPQ can be modified w/ -u[INT])
	- Breakdancer Defaults:
		num_Reads (analogous to PE) >= 2
		Score (a Poisson Determined Confidence) >= 30

	  ** we could modulate 3 of these 4 QC parameters


- what about the CNVnator VCF Output?
- Read Breakdancer and DELLY Publications
