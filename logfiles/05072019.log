- Master script is updated on cluster

- RECAP: the master script takes fqs and produces three VCF files (one from each SV caller)

- the question now is do these callers agree?
	initially observations say no
	breakpoints bt cnvnator and other two dont correlate AT ALL

- script 'script1.awk' will parse the breakpoint positions, include a 50-size window around each position, then prepare them for grep ("^number$).  When grepping cnvnator positions +/-50 to breakdancer and delly, no matches were found
	* script is also ugly and takes forever


- next time: 
        - read lit on vcf merging
        - look at KNOWN SVs on chr13 canine...are ANY tools deteciting events?
        - again, review the tools' publications
