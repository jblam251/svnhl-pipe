- previously, breakdancer was executed successfully from cluster with a tsv output file

- if we're merging vcf files, we need all files in uniform format.  two scripts explored for tsv-to-vcf transformation
	1. MetaSV's breakdancer_reader.py
	2. tbeek (ALLBio)'s breakdancer2vcf.py

- tbeek script works well, data could be formatted better for my purposes. namely moving the SVTYPE= from the INFO field to the ALT field.  this would make it more compatable with my DELLY output.  modify script??

- two new directores make in the /tool_demo/brkdncr folder:
	- metasv_scripts
	- tbeek_scripts
