- new folder created (tools_demo) for demo of all software tools
- sickle installed on local, successfully trimms PE reads
- master.sh and small_variants.sh both have PE qc functionality



TODO

* build delly portion based on ch13 sample (cant really isolate 10k reads from fastq as theyll be different bt B and F files)

* execute CNVnater and breakdancer on ch13 reads
