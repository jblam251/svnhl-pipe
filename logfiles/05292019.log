- somatic calling nearly finished...currently DELLY and brkdncr can output two SV files (one for somatic, one for germline)

- delly somatic/germiline calls should be working, however the subsetted data is small and doesn't have any somatic or germline calls contained within...could be a future issue 

- next, need to modify cnvnator script to accomidate all chromosomes (not only 13)
	* also need to modify the python cnvnator script

- new subset taken
	* case #2, first 300,000 reads (head 1,200,000)
	* subset named hundK_fq
	* includes reads from most chromosomes (not only chr13)

 - two scripts on the cluster
	- somatic0524.sh is the most recent functional version of the pipeline
	- somatic_SVonly0529.sh is the same as somatic0524 except without alignment, filtering, etc
